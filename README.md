# Obstacle-Avoidance-smart-car-using-Arduino-Uno
This project develops an obstacle avoiding robot to detect and avoid obstacles in its path. The robot is built on the Arduino platform for data processing and its software counterpart helped to communicate with the robot to send parameters for guiding movement. For obstacle detection three ultrasonic distance sensors were used that provided a wider field of detection. The robot is fully autonomous and after the initial loading of the code, it requires no user intervention during its operation. When placed in unknown environment with obstacles, it moved while avoiding all obstacles with considerable accuracy.
